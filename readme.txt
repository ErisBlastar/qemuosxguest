OSXGUEST is the QEMU version of the OSXGUEST mod that can be found at:
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~somlo/OSXKVM/

My brother Orion Blastar made the attempt on Gabriel L. Somlo's code
and I assisted my brother in getting it to compile and work.

Orion found a bug in one of the patches and reported it to Gabriel who found that the SeaBIOS and QEMU code had changed and so he fixed the problem and rewrote the patch to work now.

You'll need to compile and run this on an Apple Intel Macintosh using GNU/Linux. We don't know if it will work on Mac OSX itself. It won't work on a Non-Apple PC. You need the original Intel Mac with GNU/Linux. You'll need a 64 bit code for the network adapter to work. Plus you'll need your own Mac OSX 10.6 ISO file, we cannot give one to you for legal reasons. But the source code and binaries are all 100% free and open sourced. 

This project was attempted for running older versions of Mac OSX under GNU/Linux on an Intel Mac for people and organizations that need the older versions of Mac OSX or need that Rosetta app to run PowerMac code that only 10.6 and under have, and Apple has removed.

Both my brother Orion and I have worked for many different computer companies, and are in the process of starting up our own startup companies. This project is not a part of our startup in any way, shape, or form. Just something to help the Mac community for free.
